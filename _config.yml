description: 本网站聚焦于电白19个镇及4个街道的年例习俗，致力于全方位展示其独特魅力。在筹备过程中，虽因信息收集和照片使用授权问题，部分地区的资料尚未完善，但基于已收集到的信息，我们发现电白年例蕴含诸多有趣特点，值得深入探究。

This website is dedicated to showcasing the unique customs of the Nianli Festival across 19 towns and 4 sub-districts in Dianbai. Despite challenges in information collection and photo authorization, which have left some regions with incomplete data, the gathered information reveals many fascinating aspects of the Dianbai Nianli Festival, making it a subject worthy of in-depth exploration.

网站精心规划为四大板块：电白和年例介绍板块，旨在为用户科普电白地域文化与年例习俗的基础知识；图片和视频浏览板块，以直观的视觉呈现，让用户领略年例的精彩瞬间；电白年例各镇的信息板块，详细梳理各镇年例的特色与细节；电白年例可视化特点板块，通过可视化手段，清晰展现年例的趣味性特征，助力用户更深入地理解与感受电白年例文化。

The website is meticulously divided into four sections, the Introduction to Dianbai and Nianli section, which provides basic knowledge about Dianbai’s regional culture and the Nianli Festival; the Photo and Video Browsing section, offering a vivid visual experience of the festival’s highlights; the Information on Nianli in Each Town section, detailing the unique characteristics and nuances of the Nianli Festival in each town; and the Visualization of Nianli Features section, which employs visualization techniques to clearly present the festival’s interesting characteristics, aiding users in a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Dianbai Nianli culture.
